This is an Expo/React Native project with TypeScript.

- We are using Nativewind (TailwindCSS) for styling
- We are using file-based routing with Expo Router. The root layout is [_layout.tsx](mdc:src/app/_layout.tsx)
- All the screens are defined in `./src/app/**`
- All the components are defined in `./src/components/**`
- All other TypeScript files are in `./src/lib/**`
